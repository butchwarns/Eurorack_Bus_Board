# Eurorack_Bus_Board

A simple but versatile bus board for modular synthesizers in the eurorack format.  
It's cheap and easy to build and has many slots for connecting modules with both 10-pin and 16-pin connectors.

## Motivation

## A word of caution

If you build this bus board (or anything else involved in powering your modules for that matter), be sure you know how to check for errors in the build before actually hooking it up to power. Don't fry a module with a connector wrongly soldered upside down!
