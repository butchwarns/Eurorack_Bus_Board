# Eurorack_Bus_Board

A simple but versatile bus board for modular synthesizers in the Eurorack format.  
It's cheap and easy to build and has many slots for connecting modules with both 10-pin and 16-pin connectors.

*Eurorack_Bus_Board (v0.1.0)*

## Motivation

## A word of caution

**CAUTION:** If you build this bus board (or anything else involved in powering your modules for that matter), be sure you know how to check for errors in the build before actually hooking it up to power or any precious modules! Don't fry a module with a connector wrongly soldered upside down!

## Project status

The *main* branch of this repository holds the current tested version of the board. All potentially breaking changes will be done on the *develop* branch and the build will be tested before merging. Images in this README do not necessarily show the most recent version of the board, though all images will have version numbers in their title.

## Tech/framework used

## Features
